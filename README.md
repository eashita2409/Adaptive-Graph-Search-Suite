# Adaptive Graph Search Suite

The **Adaptive Graph Search Suite** is a high-performance, full-stack educational platform designed to visualize and analyze advanced graph traversal algorithms on realistic map topologies. At its core, the project utilizes a robust **C++17 simulation engine** capable of executing a wide array of classical algorithms, including Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A* Heuristic Search, Greedy Best-First Search, Bellman-Ford, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This low-level backend ensures highly optimized calculations, actively evaluating the time constraints, space complexities, and microsecond-level execution latency of paths mapping across thousands of nodes.

Bridging the native C++ engine is a lightweight **Python web server** that seamlessly coordinates backend-to-frontend communication. It also manages an onboard map generator that programmatically builds and serves complex JSON graph datasets themed around Indian contexts—such as the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, massive Delhi NCR road layouts, Bengaluru traffic hubs, and structured dimensional grids. 

The user experience is anchored by a stunning, premium **glassmorphism web interface** built natively with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. As algorithms execute on the backend, the UI’s interactive HTML5 `<canvas>` parses the generated computation traces to vividly animate the step-by-step search process. The visualization engine incorporates silky-smooth mouse panning, dynamic zooming, adjustable playback speeds, and eye-catching neon glows that meticulously differentiate between the active search frontiers and the final deduced shortest path. 

Ultimately, the Adaptive Graph Search Suite serves as a powerful, visually captivating bridge between theoretical computer science and practical software engineering, allowing users to tangibly watch and compare how algorithmic logic systematically conquers complex geographic networks.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is structured into three strictly decoupled layers, communicating seamlessly via structured JSON data pipelines:

1.  **Core C++ Engine (`src/`):** 
    Pure object-oriented C++ classes. Includes an abstract `Algorithm` interface and a `Graph` class storing data in `std::unordered_map` and adjacency lists. Time measurements use `<chrono>`. Outputs rich trace metadata including Time/Space complexities.
2.  **API Bridge (`server.py`):**
    A dependency-free Python backend routing HTTP logic dynamically to the compiled C++ executable (`subprocess.run()`). It queries `data/maps/` structures and serves the frontend.
3.  **Visualization Client (`ui/`):**
    A reactive GUI utilizing native JS and the Canvas API. Includes pan/zoom capabilities, playback controls, and real-time complexity/latency performance data panels.
